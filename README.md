## What I Did in This Project

In the **React Photo Album** project, I focused on implementing the following:

- **React Functional Components**:
  - Developed the main `App` component that serves as the entry point for the application.
  - Used functional components to structure the layout efficiently.

- **Material UI Integration**:
  - Integrated Material UI components such as `AppBar`, `Typography`, `Card`, and `Grid` to build a visually appealing user interface.
  - Employed Material UI's responsive design features to ensure the app looks great on all screen sizes.
  - Implemented typography styles for clear readability and a visually appealing design.

- **Custom Styling with Emotion**:
  - Utilized **Emotion** for custom styling to enhance the visual presentation of the app.
  - Defined styles for the container, buttons, cards, and footer using MUI's styling capabilities.

- **Responsive Grid Layout**:
  - Created a responsive grid layout that adjusts the number of columns based on the screen size, ensuring optimal display of photos.

- **Card Functionality**:
  - Designed reusable `Card` components to display images along with descriptions, creating an engaging experience for users.

- **Footer Implementation**:
  - Added a footer section to provide a general footer information and enhance the layout's overall balance.
